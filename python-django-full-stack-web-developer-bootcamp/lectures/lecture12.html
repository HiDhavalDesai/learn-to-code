<!-- This is how an image is added to HTML, <img src =''>
src stands for source and alt stands for alternate; it's a self closing tag; for src we just add the link to the image. -->

<img src="https://static.djangoproject.com/img/logos/django-logo-positive.png" alt="Image not found"> <!-- alt="django.png image not found"-->
<!-- the file path matters, so becareful. -->
<!-- if the image is not found, the alternative will take over; the best thing to do would be to use the file name and then write not found, so you can fix your errors easily. -->

<!-- A-tag -->
<!-- Created a new page lecture12b.html -->

<a href="lecture12b.html">A New Page</a>
<!-- href means reference to html file; full file path is not added, becasue it's in the same folder; otherwise you would need to add the entire path -->

<!-- HTTP is needed when referencing to things online. -->
