<!-- Notes: You don't need to have a thead tag to create a table, but it's nice to have for anyone looking at the table -->

<!-- <table> = HTML tag to let you know that there is a table here
<thead> = allows you to set the first row or the header row of the table
<th> = inside of thead, which are the actual elements that you are placing inside of that header; name of the columns in the table.
<tr> = table rows
<td> = each of the table elements inside; correspond to each column

<table>   telling the code we have a table
<thead>  Where we want column names to go
<th>Number</th>  First column
<th>color</th>  Second Column
<th>country</th>  Third colum
</thead>
<tr> The first row of that table.
<td></td>   The first row and first column of that table name.
<td></td>    The first row and the second column of that table.
<td></td>   The first row and the third column of that table.
</tr>
<tr>  the second row of that table.

</table> -->
