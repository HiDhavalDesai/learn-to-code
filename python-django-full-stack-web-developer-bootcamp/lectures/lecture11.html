    <!-- div tag stands for division; allows you to tie together groups of elements into basically generic contrainers -->
      <div class="groupone"><!-- Allows you to name this division and apply styles to that class  -->
        <h1>Group 1</h1>
        <p>I want to <span>>be together in</span> group 1</p>
          <!-- Right now, we won't noice a change, but with CSS, we can add styles to a division with a class name -->
      </div>
      <!-- Span tags are more inline, instead of grabbing and entire contrainer; no difference at the moment, because we don't have css. -->
