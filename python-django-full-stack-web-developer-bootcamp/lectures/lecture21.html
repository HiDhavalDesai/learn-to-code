<h4>Are you from inside the US or Outside of US?</h4>
<label for="insideofUS">Inside of US</label>
<input id="insideofUS" type="radio" name="loc" value="InsideofUS">
<label for="outsideofUS">Outside of US</label>
<input id="outsideofUS" type="radio" name="loc" value="OutsideofUS">
<!-- the for tag in label allows me to connect to the ID in the input tag; this way a label can connect to an input -->
<!-- Then to connect the radio buttons, so you can switch them on and off, you make the names the same, which connects the buttons together. The values is what will display on the URL - ?loc=InsideofUS -->
<!-- Side note for values in the radio buttons, make sure they are oneworld, no spaces -->

<h4>How was your service?</h4>
<select class="" name="stars">
  <!-- Class here will be used for CSS -->
  <option value="null"></option>
  <!-- I just added a null value to see what would happen -->
  <option value="Great">3</option>
  <option value="Okay">2</option>
  <option value="Bad">1</option>
  <!-- A realist example would have the numbers in value instead of as options. This is because then you can do analysis of them. -->
</select>
<!-- The enture URL looks like - ?loc=InsideofUS&stars=Okay -->
<h4>Oher Feedback:</h4>
<textarea name="feedback" rows="8" cols="80"></textarea>
<!-- The textarea is used when you want a written feedback or something; the input type text won't work, because everything is in one line. -->
