<h1>Forms and Labels</h1>
<form>
<p>Enter Email:</p>
<input type="email" name="useremail" value="">
<!-- THe URL changed, at the end the following was added - ?useremail=dsad%40(@)gmail.com -->

<p>Enter Text</p>
<input type="text" name="userinput" value="">

<input type="submit" name="" value="submit">
</form>
<!-- the userinput give you ?userinput=dsada -->
<br>

<!-- Action happening when you click submit Let's go to another website -->
<form class="" action="https://www.facebook.com" method="get">
  <!-- post vs get will be discussed next time -->
  <p>Enter Text and go to facebook.com</p>
<input type="text" name="userinput" value="text goes here">
<input type="submit" name="" value="submit">
<!-- Because I used value to be my text, I got that value output -->
<!-- results: https://www.facebook.com/?userinput=text+goes+here -->
</form>
<br>

<!-- Labels -->
<form class="" action="index.html" method="post">
<p>Enter Text</p>
<input type="text" name="" value="">
<!-- The paragraph and the input are in it's own block, that is why there is space between them. -->
<!-- You may want to label everything on a form incase there are multiple inputs; for example like a job application  -->
</form>
<br><br><br>

<!-- Bad way of using labels; individual -->
<form class="" action="index.html" method="post">
<label for="">Label - Enter Text
<input type="text" name="" value="">
</label>
<!-- This is the more repeatable way, but we don't want to do that, we want to practice dry coding principles -->
<!-- DRY coding principles - Donâ€™t repeat yourself. -->

<!-- If you have multiple inputs, you will have to keep calling labels; we don't want to call label and then text every time. -->
</form>

<!-- The good way of using labels -->
<form class="" action="index.html" method="post">
<label for="userinput">Enter Input:</label>
<input id="userinput" type="text" name="" value="Hello!">
<!-- We will talk more about ID in CSS; the for in label needs to match the ID in input; ID is a unique identyer in HTML tag; will make more sense when we want to uniqely style HTML tags based off some sort of ID-->
<br>
<!-- the value in input needs to be deleted for you to udpate the text, so instead we can use placeholder, which will allow the user to keep writing without having to delete the text -->
<input type="text" name="" Placeholder="First Name" required>
<!-- Required at the end, will make it so the input is required to be entered, before the form is submitted. -->
<input type="submit" name="" value="submit">

</form>
